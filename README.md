# roland-d50
Windows sound-designer for the Roland D-50 synth

This project builds with the free version of Embarcadero RAD Studio C++ Builder 10.2 (Tokyo).

The program includes a delphi pascal midi library by David Churcher I found online that I could not get to work with newer versions of windows and so I modified it. Works now on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10.

The program can save and restore all of your existing Roland D50 patches and can generate new patches by itself with infinite FM synthesis possibilities!

Use at your own risk (the usual...)

All you vintage synth enthusiasts, enjoy! :-)
